## Monorepo Support Comparison

### Railway Monorepo Support ✅

**How it works:**
1. **Multiple Services:** Create separate services for frontend and backend
2. **Root Directory:** Set root directory per service:
   - Backend service: Root = `/backend`
   - Frontend service: Root = `/frontend`
3. **Auto-detection:** Railway can auto-detect JavaScript monorepos (Yarn workspaces, Lerna)
4. **Independent Deployments:** Each service deploys independently when its directory changes

**Example Setup:**
```
your-repo/
├── backend/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── Dockerfile (or Railway auto-detects)
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── Dockerfile
└── package.json (workspace root, optional)
```

**Configuration:**
- Each service gets its own Railway service
- Set "Root Directory" in service settings
- Configure build/start commands per service
- Deployments only trigger on relevant file changes

**Pros:**
- ✅ Very intuitive setup
- ✅ Automatic detection for common monorepo tools
- ✅ Independent scaling per service
- ✅ Separate environment variables per service

---

### Render Monorepo Support ✅

**How it works:**
1. **Multiple Services:** Create separate web services for frontend and backend
2. **Root Directory:** Set root directory per service:
   - Backend service: Root = `/backend`
   - Frontend service: Root = `/frontend`
3. **Build Filters:** Optional glob patterns to fine-tune deployment triggers
4. **Independent Deployments:** Each service deploys only when its directory changes

**Example Setup:**
```
your-repo/
├── backend/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── Dockerfile
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── Dockerfile
└── .gitignore
```

**Configuration:**
- Create separate "Web Service" for each app
- Set "Root Directory" in service settings
- Optional: Configure build filters (e.g., ignore `*.md` changes)
- Each service has independent environment variables

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple root directory configuration
- ✅ Build filters for fine-grained control
- ✅ Independent scaling and configuration
- ✅ Free tier available for testing

---

### Comparison: Railway vs Render for Monorepos

| Feature | Railway | Render |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Root Directory | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Auto-detection | ✅ Yarn/Lerna | ❌ Manual setup |
| Build Filters | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (glob patterns) |
| Setup Complexity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very Easy | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Easy |
| Documentation | Excellent | Good |
| **Winner** | **Slightly better** | Good alternative |

**Verdict:** Both handle monorepos excellently. Railway has slightly better auto-detection, while Render offers more granular build filter control.

---

### AWS Lambda Monorepo Support ⚠️

**How it works:**
- AWS Lambda doesn't directly support monorepos
- You need to:
  1. Build/deploy each service separately
  2. Use separate Lambda functions per service
  3. Configure API Gateway routes per function
  4. Handle build artifacts manually

**Workarounds:**
- Use AWS SAM or Serverless Framework
- Build scripts to package only relevant directories
- More complex CI/CD setup required

**Verdict:** More complex than Railway/Render, but doable with proper tooling.
